# RemoteControlDownload


### Motivation

Recently I bought a Raspberry Pi4 and I want to use this powerful platform to manage resource downloading when I am not at house.

I plan to use several techniques to finish this project:

- ``Qt`` to build a beautiful GUI
- ``Thunder Download API`` to achieve resource downloading by P2P
- ``Intranet Penetration`` to control the machine remotely
